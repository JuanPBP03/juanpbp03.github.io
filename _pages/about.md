# My Journey
## Where It All Began  
I’ve always been drawn to learning and figuring things out. As a kid, I always wanted a chemistry kit, got way too into Bill Nye the Science Guy, and would take things apart just to see what was inside. Whether it was computers, machines, or the world around me, I always wanted to understand things more deeply and I was lucky to be surrounded by people who encouraged that curiosity.

### Discovering Engineering 
In my high school computer engineering class, we weren’t just handed instructions&mdash;we had the freedom to experiment, to build with whatever materials were on hand, and to approach problems in our own way. We made all kinds of projects: a **line-following car, a small robotic arm, and even an elastic-band-powered propeller vehicle that rode on a string**. We learned to solder, build circuits, program, and maybe most importantly, to harness our creativity, all under the guidance of a rambunctious and unforgettable teacher.  

That experience cemented my love for problem-solving and creating. It wasn’t just about what we built. It was about the process, the freedom to explore, and the excitement of making something work.  

## Where I Am Now  
Now, as an **engineering student at Humber Polytechnic**, I’ve continued leaning into hands-on work, especially anything that involves embedded systems, control, or design, and I’ve found that what excites me most is when hardware and software come together to make something real.

But, engineering isn’t just a degree or a career I'm working towards. I believe that engineering is a way of life that shapes the way I move through the world. It shows up in how I break down problems, look for patterns, think in systems, and constantly try to improve&mdash;all driven by endless curiosity. 

Outside of school, I enjoy building computers, making music, exploring visual arts, and playing both board and video games. I also enjoy spending time outdoors, trying new things, and learning about language and how people think. I’m happiest when I’m around likeminded people who are curious, driven, and excited about what they do.

## Purpose of This Website 
Talking about yourself always feels a bit strange, but I wanted to build this site into a space that shows the connection between what I care about and what I build, a way to **document my journey, organize my thoughts, and build something that grows with me**. It’s a mix of technical explorations, personal reflections, and anything else I find worth sharing.   

# **Let’s Connect!**
Feel free to [reach out](/contact/), I'm always open to sharing ideas, collaborating on projects, or just meeting someone new!

Thanks for stopping by!
