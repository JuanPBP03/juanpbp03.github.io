## My Journey
#### Where It All Began  
I’ve always been drawn to learning and figuring things out. As a kid, I was fascinated by anything that explained how the world worked. Watching *Bill Nye the Science Guy* made science feel exciting and hands-on, and that curiosity stuck with me. Whether it was computers, machines, or random scientific concepts, I always wanted to know more and I was surrounded by problem-solvers&mdash;people who built things, worked on projects, and tackled challenges head on.

#### Discovering Engineering 
In my high school computer engineering class, we weren’t just handed instructions&mdash;we had the freedom to experiment, to build with whatever materials were on hand, and to approach problems in our own way. We made all kinds of projects: a **line-following car, a small robotic arm, and even an elastic-band-powered propeller vehicle that rode on a string**. We learned to solder, build circuits, program, and maybe most importantly, to harness our creativity, all under the guidance of a rambunctious and unforgettable teacher.  

That experience cemented my love for problem-solving and creating. It wasn’t just about what we built—it was about the process, the freedom to explore, and the excitement of making something work.  

## Where I Am Now  
Now, as an **engineering student** at Humber Polytechnic, I still find myself drawn to hands-on projects and things that make me step back and rethink what I know. Beyond that, I’ve always been interested in more than just engineering. I get lost in music, dive into interesting topics, and enjoy picking things apart—sometimes literally, sometimes just to understand them better. I don’t know exactly where this path will take me, but that’s part of what keeps it exciting.  
#### The Purpose of This Website  
I created this site as a way to **document my journey, organize my thoughts, and have a space that evolves with me**. It’s a mix of technical explorations, personal reflections, and anything else I find worth sharing.
