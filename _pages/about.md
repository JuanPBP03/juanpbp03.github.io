## My Journey
#### Where It All Began  
Iâ€™ve always been drawn to learning and figuring things out. As a kid, I was fascinated by anything that explained how the world worked. Watching *Bill Nye the Science Guy* made science feel exciting and hands-on, and that curiosity stuck with me. Whether it was computers, machines, or random scientific concepts, I always wanted to know more.    

Growing up, I was surrounded by problem-solversâ€”people who built things, worked on projects, and tackled challenges head on. That environment naturally pulled me toward engineering, by the time I was 13, I had built my first PC. Those experiences set the foundation for my love of technology and sowed the seeds for my passion for engineering.

#### Discovering Engineering 
In high school, I took a computer engineering class that was unlike any other. We werenâ€™t just handed instructionsâ€”we had the freedom to experiment, to build with whatever materials were on hand, and to approach problems in our own way. We made all kinds of projects: a **line-following car, a small robotic arm, and even an elastic-band-powered propeller vehicle that rode on a string**. We learned to **solder, build circuits, and work hands-on with electronics**, all under the guidance of a rambunctious and unforgettable teacher.  

That experience cemented my love for problem-solving and creating things from scratch. It wasnâ€™t just about what we builtâ€”it was about the process, the freedom to explore, and the excitement of making something work.  

## Where I Am Now  
Now, as an **engineering student** at Humber Polytechnic, I still find myself drawn to hands-on projects and things that make me step back and rethink what I know. Beyond that, Iâ€™ve always been interested in more than just engineering. I get lost in music, dive into interesting topics, and enjoy picking things apartâ€”sometimes literally, sometimes just to understand them better. I donâ€™t know exactly where this path will take me, but thatâ€™s part of what keeps it exciting.  

#### The Purpose of This Website  
I created this site as a way to **document my journey, organize my thoughts, and have a space that evolves with me**. Itâ€™s a mix of technical explorations, personal reflections, and anything else I find worth sharing.
